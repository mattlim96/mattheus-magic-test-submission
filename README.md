# Data Scientist Assessment

This test is designed to assess your ability to analyze real-time data output from the MediaPipe computer vision library.

MediaPipe performs pose analysis by converting a video feed of a person into a stream of 33 3D coordinates, representing points on the personâ€™s body. You will need to create algorithms that analyze this stream of pose data to determine how well the subject performs the following exercise: [**Alternating Lunge**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTej-ax9XiA&ab_channel=FitnessBlender).

## Instructions

1. Download and setup Android Studio.
2. Download the app starter code. (this magic-test repository)
3. `ExerciseRepCounterImpl` is where you will need to create your algorithms for analyzing the exercise being performed in the video linked above. Use the functions `incrementRepCount()` and `sendProgressUpdate()` to update the app UI with the output of your algorithms which must:
   - Count exercise repetitions.
   - Analyze the progress of the current movement. The progress bar should fill gradually as the user performs the movement, and reduce to 0 as the user returns to the start position. Employ the appropriate techniques to handle any fluctuations in the data to ensure smooth progress updates.
